# The Boston housing prices dataset has an ethical problem: as
# investigated in [1], the authors of this dataset engineered a
# non-invertible variable "B" assuming that racial self-segregation had a
# positive impact on house prices [2]. Furthermore the goal of the
# research that led to the creation of this dataset was to study the
# impact of air quality but it did not give adequate demonstration of the
# validity of this assumption.
#
# The scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of
# this dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate
# about ethical issues in data science and machine learning.
#
# In this special case, you can fetch the dataset from the original
# source::
#
#     import pandas as pd
#     import numpy as np
#
#     data_url = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston"
#     raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, sep="\s+", skiprows=22, header=None)
#     data = np.hstack([raw_df.values[::2, :], raw_df.values[1::2, :2]])
#     target = raw_df.values[1::2, 2]
#
# Alternative datasets include the California housing dataset and the
# Ames housing dataset. You can load the datasets as follows::
#
#     from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
#     housing = fetch_california_housing()
#
# for the California housing dataset and::
#
#     from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
#     housing = fetch_openml(name="house_prices", as_frame=True)
#
# for the Ames housing dataset.
